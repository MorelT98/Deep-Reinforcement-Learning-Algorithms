# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms
## Using machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques, we train agents to play the games CartPole and Mountain Car, present in the Open AI gym environment.
### Techniques used:
- RBF (Radial Basis Function) Networks
- N step method
- TD lambda
- Q Learning
- Deep Q Networks
- Policy Gradient
